# Batch QR Code Tracking System
A full-stack application to track and monitor fertilizer batch movements via QR codes, with real-time scan logging (IP + geolocation), Code Blue alerts, and a Google Sheets-backed monitoring system.

## ðŸ§© Features
### ðŸ”¹ Batch QR Generator
Generates a unique QR code per batch containing:
- Batch ID
- Production Date
- Plant Location
- Product Type
- Vehicle Number
### ðŸ”¹ View Database
- Displays saved batches
- Each entry shows:
 - Batch info
 - QR code
 - Download All as CSV option (platform-specific)
### ðŸ”¹ Code Blue
- Mark critical or sensitive batches as Code Blue
- Special QR codes for these trigger logging
### ðŸ”¹ Monitor (Scan Logger)
- Fetches real-time scan logs from backend
- Displays:
 - IP Address
 - Location (City, Region, Country)
 - Timestamp
 - Batch ID
- Data comes from Google Sheets API via Apps Script endpoint
- Manual Refresh button and auto-refresh every 10s

## Tech Stack
### ðŸ”¹ Frontend (Flutter)
- Flutter Web + Android (cross-platform)
- CSV export (conditional)
- QR code generation
- IP/location-based logging links for Code Blue QR codes
### ðŸ”¹ Backend (FastAPI on Render)
- /scan/<batchID> route:
 - Logs IP & geolocation via IPinfo.io
 - Writes to a connected Google Sheet using a published Apps Script webhook
- /scanlogs route:
 - Fetches scan logs in JSON format for frontend
### ðŸ”¹ Logging Backend (Google Sheets)
- Stores logs as:
 - Timestamp
 - Batch ID
 - IP Address
 - Location

## How It Works
### 1. Create QR Code:
Generate QR from user inputs â†’ Encodes info into a URL.
### 2. Scan Happens:
External apps (like Google Lens) scan the QR â†’ open backend URL (/scan/BATCHID).
### 3. Log Captured:
Backend extracts IP + geo-location â†’ sends it to Google Sheet.
### 4. Frontend Monitor:
Displays latest entries.

## Security Notes
- No personal data is collected.
- IP & location are fetched only when Code Blue QR is scanned.
- All logs stored securely in your controlled Google Sheet.

## Deployment
### Backend (FastAPI on Render)
1. Deploy main.py FastAPI backend
2. Set environment variable: GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = Your Apps Script Webhook URL
### Flutter Frontend
1. Run on mobile (flutter run)
2. Or build for web (flutter build web)
3. Host via Firebase, GitHub Pages, or a local server
